            <h2>Old Reliable</h2>

            <p>
                Gordo was one of the first monkeys to make it into space as part of NASA's space program. 
                Eight monkeys had flown on NASA missions before him, five of whom went by the name of Albert.
            </p>

            <p>
                Gordo's historic flight took place on December 13, 1958 when he took off from Cape Canaveral 
                for a 15 minute flight into space. Even though he was weightless for over 8 minutes the on-board 
                instruments indicated that Gordo enjoyed his journey into space. Scientists monitoring the 
                flight were pleased to note that the only slight side effect Gordo suffered from the entry into 
                space was a modest slowing of his pulse.

                <h3>The Mission</h3>

                <p>
                    The rocket carrying Gordo into space would take off from the Atlantic Missile Range at Cape 
                    Canaveral, travel further than any monkey had ever travelled before - over 1,500 miles - and 
                    reach a height of 310 miles <strong>(500 km)</strong> before returning to Earth and landing in the South Atlantic, 
                    1,302 nautical miles south of Cape Canaveral.

                    The Jupiter IRBM <strong>(Intermediate Range Ballistic Missile)</strong> was originally developed by the US Army 
                    as a long-range successor to its PGM-11 Redstone missile, but was eventually taken over and 
                    deployed by the USAF for political reasons. It was also the only one of the United States' early 
                    stategic ballistic missiles with some mobility.

                <h3>The Journey</h3>

                <p>
                    Gordo wore a specially customised space suit custom made for a monkey about <em>one foot tall</em>. The 
                    space suit was fitted with instruments, including temperature meters and microphones which 
                    recorded his historic suborbital journey, considered one of the outstanding achievements of space 
                    research.
