            <h2>Progressive Enhancement</h2>
            <p>
                Progressive Enhancement is the process of first developing the content of your website, marking up all
                of your html, then styling it, with css, and finishing it off by adding functionality and extentions,
                with javascript. Progressive Enhancement is very important because it help to streamline the
                development process and allows for developers to more easily develop content can be available for
                everyone. Separating out the different parts of a website into 3 main sections really to not get lost or
                lose track of things inside the code and allows you to find it and change it much more easily rather
                than have html, css and js jumbled together in one place. You can worry less about changing the wrong
                thing and messing up everything else.

            <h2>SpaceX Dragon Reflection</h2>
            <p>
                Revising my first draft, I didn't get too much feed back. I mostly just heard that it looked good or
                decent. The most I got was that my pages were very bland and not appealing to
                look at. I didn't really know what I could do to remedy that so I mainly started trying to style the
                pages in a way to break up all of the white space and create some variance in what is shown instead of
                just a dull white or black background. Looking back on it, it was probably the color and lack of visuals
                like picture that were mostly bringing the appeal down. If I were to redo this completely I would start
                by looking at other well-made websites this time to get a feel for how everything should fit together
                and where I can incorporate images.
